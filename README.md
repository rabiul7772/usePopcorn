🚀 Just launched my latest React project: usePopcorn 🍿 – A Movie Search & Rating App!

🎥 Description:
usePopcorn is a React-based movie search and rating application powered by the OMDb API. It allows users to search for movies, view detailed information, and manage a personal watched list with their own ratings.

🛠️ Key Features:

🔍 Search Functionality – Real-time movie search with results fetched from OMDb API.

🎬 Movie Details – Click to view in-depth info about selected movies.

✅ Watched List Management – Add movies to a personal list, rate them, and see:

Data fetching

Handling key events

📚 Key Takeaways:

children prop usage

Data fetching & error handling

Reusable component architecture

Creating and managing custom hooks

Handling side effects with useEffect

💡 Interesting Learning:
One of the most insightful parts was using the useEffect cleanup function to cancel ongoing API requests when a new one is fired.
This avoids unnecessary network calls and outdated data displays, improving both performance and user experience.
